# csp
This project aims to update the open problems in Jim Pitman's Combinatorial Stochastic Processes book. 

We are looking for contributors, who are interested in saying a few things about an open problem of their choice.

Each contributor does a mini literature review on the problem, and send in a summary, split into two parts: latex and bib.

The latex file contains the problem description, and perhaps some comments (eg: your own motivation, references to solutions, partial solutions...)

The bib file contains the references.

If you are contributing to a new problem, please submit a latex file containing a mini literature review, and a bib file containing references. 

If you are contributing to an existing latex file substantially (beyond cosmetic edits), please add your name and github ID to the authors list. 

There is a template in
https://github.com/princengoc/csp/tree/master/sampleFormat
Please refer to this template for stylistic and naming conventions.

There are two ways to send in files to the project. The preferred option is that you request to be a contributor to this github. Otherwise, you can send the tex and bib files to Ngoc Tran (@math.utexas), or Jim Pitman (@stat.berkeley).

Thank you for your interest! Suggestions most welcomed!
