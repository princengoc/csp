This project aims to update the open problems in Jim Pitman's Combinatorial Stochastic Processes book. 

If you are contributing to a new problem, please submit a latex file containing a mini literature review, and a bib file containing references. 

If you are contributing to an existing latex file substantially (beyond cosmetic edits), please add your name and github ID to the authors list. 

Please follow the style and naming convention set out by the files in folder named "sampleFormat".
