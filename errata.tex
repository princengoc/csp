\maketitle

Equation (0.22): this particular construction of $BES(3)$ bridge from $x$ to $y$ is correct only if either $x = 0$ or $y = 0$. Discussions that follow, including equation (0.27), only consider these cases and thus are correct. The source of the problem is a similar false statement in a Lemma
of reference [358] (although no further errors were introduced, as this lemma was only used when one of the endpoints is 0). 

Between (3.35) and (3.36):  It should be $\Gamma(1/\alpha)/S_\alpha$ instead of multiplied by $S_\alpha$.
