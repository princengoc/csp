\subsection{The problem}%a self-contained description of the problem

Problem 4.5.6 in \cite[page 96]{MR2245368}, is on the existence of $\alpha$-fragmentation. 
It is shown in \cite[Chapter 9]{MR2245368} that for $\alpha = 1/2$, there is a natural construction of $\Pi_\infty(\lambda), \lambda \geq 0)$ as a partition valued fragmentation process, meaning that $\Pi_\infty(\lambda)$ is constructed for each $\lambda$ on the same probability space, in such a way that $\Pi_\infty(\lambda)$ is a coarser partition than $\Pi_\infty(\mu)$ whenever $\lambda < \mu$. Does there exist a similar construction for index $\alpha \neq 1/2$? 

\subsection{Literature review} %put a mini review of the problem: for example, motivations, current status, thoughts, ...  

A natural guess is that
such a construction might be made with one of the self-similar fragmentation
processes of Bertoin \cite{MR1899456}, but Miermont and Schweinsberg \cite{MR2053052} have shown that
a construction of this form is possible only for $\alpha = 1/2$.
